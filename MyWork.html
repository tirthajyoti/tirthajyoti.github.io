<h2><i>My experience with data analytics/machine learning</i></h2>
<p><span style=color:blue><font size="4">My transition from a 'user' of tools to a hands-on data science practitioner</font></span>
<p>
<i>Throughout my career, I have worked with complex, high-volume, and high-dimensional scientific and engineering data.</i> I have extracted and analyzed large datasets, created advanced visualizations, and presented insights to my technical teams. But in all those endeavors, I was largely dependent on a fixed set of tools and was never exposed to the true power of underlying mechanics of data analysis.
</p>
<p>However, since last 2 years, I have become keenly interested in the tools and algorithms which work under the hood and this has opened up a world of possibilities for me. I have discovered the joy of not depending on enterprise tools and writing my own functions and codes in languages such as Python or R. This has given me a much broader perspective and much sharper insights into any data related problem. I have actively started contributing to open-source communities by sharing my analytics projects on Github and social forums. In parallel, I have started learning about core algorithms and how they solve the range of analysis and machine learning problems. I am appreciating the whole process deeply and feeling empowered to peel back the layers. <i>Today, I am able to think about a data problem from multiple viewpoints and analyze/model/learm from it with high degree scientific rigor using custom code and algorithms.</i></p>

<p><span style=color:blue><font size="4">Continuing education in data analytics and machine learning</font></span>
<p>I have audited multitude of courses on statistics, algorithms, machine learning, and analytics on online platforms such as Coursera and edX. Some of the prominent ones are listed here</p>
<li><i>“Artificial Intelligence: An Introduction To Neural Networks And Deep Learning”</i>, Stanford Continuing Studies, Stanford University (on-campus)</li>
<li><i>“Data Science: Data to Insights”</i>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT Professional Program</li>
<li><i>Machine Learning</i> (Coursera - Stanford University)</li>
<li><i>Data Science MicroMasters program</i> (edX - UC San Diego)</li>
<li><i>Deep Learning specialization</i> (Coursera - deeplearning.ai)</li>
<li><i>Machine Learning with Case Studies Approach</i> (Coursera – University of Washington)</li>
<li><i>Algorithm Design and Analysis</i> (edX – Penn State University)</li>
<li><i>Artificial Intelligence</i> (edX – Columbia University)</li>
<li><i>Bayesian statistics - Techniques and Models</i> (Coursera – UC Santa Cruz)</li>

Apart from these, I am registered to start a <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/academics/degrees/masters/analytics-online-degree-oms-analytics"><b>Masters of Science (MS)Degree in Analytics</a></b> (specializing in <a href="https://pe.gatech.edu/master-science-degrees/analytics/program-information/computational-data-analytics-track">Computational Data Analytics)</a> from Georgia Tech this Fall (August 2018).

<p><span style=color:blue><font size="4">Applying analytics and machine learning to my domain</font></span>
<p>
I have been working on following projects, related to machine learning, in my domain,
<p><li> <b><span style="background-color: #AAB7B8">Python-based data analytics framework for semiconductor manufacturing</span></b>: Using Python-based Jupyter notebooks for analyzing silicon wafer processing data. This involves failure bin analysis, statistical plotting, normality analysis, quantile plots, creating parametric maps out of positional data, bi-variate regression model builds, causality discovery by multi-variate regression pipeline, outlier detection with Gaussian mixture models, etc. </li></p>
<p><li><b><span style="background-color: #AAB7B8">Semiconductor device design automation pipeline with machine learning</span></b>: This project aims to automate/aid the complex technology development and device design tasks in the field of high-power semiconductors, using machine learning and statistical modeling. Goal is to develop an integrated software platform which can control various Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulation programs, extract the relevant outputs from those simulations, and build a design guideline for optimal performance and reliability in a given power management application.</li></p>
<p><li><b><span style="background-color: #AAB7B8">Deep learning-based semiconductor design feature extraction</span></b>: Goal of this project is to use deep learning framework to mimic ‘high-level’ design experience of domain experts (in the field of semiconductor processing, device, and packaging) by classification of designs into categories such as ‘sub-optimal’ or ‘aggressive’.</li></p>

<p><span style=color:blue><font size="4">Consultancy with a AI-based startup</font></span>
<p>
Follwoing my passion about AI/ML/data science, in my spare time, I work with a AI-driven starup in Palo Alto, CA as a Consulting Scientist. My responsibility is to advise on <b><i>generative models for software test scripts and test data</b></i>, and to work with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) team to <b><i>discover hidden patterns in the test scripts of various web-based applications with the eventual goal of automating the testing process</i></b> to the largest extent possible. I intend to apply <b><i>statistical modeling techniques</b></i> (such as <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/gaussian-mixture-model/">Gaussian mixture-models</a>, frequency counters, topic modeling, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-variational-autoencoders-1bfe67eb5daf">variational autoencoder</a>, etc.) along with <b><i>text-mining algorithms</b></i> to generate synthetic test scripts and then process them through a <b><i>deep learning model</b></i> to obtain highly accurate automatic test case synthesis from minimal seed data set.</p>
